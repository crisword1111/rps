ROCK PAPERS SCISSORS GAME TOP

Day 1:

-I find my way to "create a func" that randomly return a string from the array (rock, paper or scissor).

-I used a console.log command to review it in the console

-What took me a lot was realizing that the return at the end of the func has to be specific with optionUse and not in general.

-Just type the func "play" with the two parameters (playerSelector, computerSelector)
not develop anything in there yet.
